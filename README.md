You must have node.js installed as well as the npm module socket.io. Then, just run "node server/server.js". This will create a webserver to serve the files as well as handle the communication between players. To play, visit 127.0.0.1 in your favorite web browser (Chrome or Firefox).

You need two players to play the game (both have to access the same page, the game will start automatically).
